### 👩‍💻 About Me
I'm **Anahi Perez**, a rising senior at Emory University double majoring in **Computer Science and Mathematics**, with plans to complete a **dual degree in Biomedical Engineering** at Georgia Tech. My interests lie at the intersection of **AI, healthcare innovation, and ethical tech policy**. I’m passionate about using technology to uplift underrepresented communities, especially children with disabilities in low-income areas.

I’ve interned at **PwC** in healthcare tech consulting, conducted AI market analysis for **HP Tech Ventures**, and explored civic innovation through Emory’s **AI.Data Lab**. I’m also a mentor and advocate for first-gen and low-income students navigating STEM careers.
